Problem Description:

Given a set of symbols and their frequency of usage, find a binary code for each symbol, such that:
a. Binary code for any symbol is not the prefix of the binary code of another symbol.
b. The weighted length of codes for all the symbols (weighted by the usage frequency) is minimized.
